## UX

### Site Goals & Audience

In general, the Snapgram provides a similar experience to the most popular social media apps, such as Instagram, with the added implementation of AI.
Embedding a chat function with the latest technology makes Snapgram a pioneer in the constantly evolving field of sociial media. The broader idea is to allow the users to edit photos, write captions/comments/posts, translate content, create a personal algorith based on interestes and enhance the user experience using AI. As the site grows, the AI-tool will be applied into multiple aspects of the platform with the end goal being the AI transforming into a "spider in the web", i.e. becoming the cornerstone on which the appÂ´s foundation rests and grows. Advertisment will not be a significant generater of income for Snapgram but it is not excluded from future plans. In order to avoid irriitating ads, fees can be collected for using certain feautures such as advertising large scale events hosted by establisshed companies.  


 ### Site layout

The site follows a harmonious grid-based layout in which all components align. This creates a streamline expereince as the user scrolls and interacts with the site. 
Snapgram follows the general layout of popular social media apps as they have proven to work and function in the most logical way possible.
Everything the user needs on a regular basis is only one click away. More advanced setting and functions are easy to find thanks to the clean and minimalistic layout. 

### Color Scheme

Harmonious, muted and soft colours were selected in order to not interrupt the focus of the user as they scroll. 
The colours are neutral as not to clash nor draw attention from the uploaded images.
The dominating colours of Snapgram can be visualized by the image below:

XXXXXXXXXX COlour SCHEME


### Symbols/ Icons

Symbols and icons have become a global language in the most simplistic way possible. 
This has become familiar with a majority of social media users thus motivating the use of icons as shortcuts/links and as a tool of navigation.

### Logo
A straight forward, elegant and familiar logo spelling out the name "Snapgram". 
The cursive feels more traditional and intimate, creating trust and a nostalgic feeling for the user.

### Current User Goals
